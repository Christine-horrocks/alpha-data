# alpha-data
Placeholder repository for digtal land alpha data sets.

The subdirectories of this repository represent data sets which are organised by alpha projects being run the Digital Land organisation.

Prototypes of services using this data are being built by Digital Land.

The intention is for these data sets to evolve here as the alpha projects progress. Eventually, if/when real data sets are published by planning authorities these datasets will no longer be necessary.


## Data sets

### MHCLG Registers

The [mhclg-registers](mhclg-registers) subdirectory is the placeholder for registers of data that will eventually be run and published by MHCLG.


### Developer contributions

The subdirectory [developer-contributions](developer-contributions) contains files representing that may be published
according to [this proposed common data format.](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/).
