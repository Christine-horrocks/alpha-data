# alpha-data
Placeholder repository for digtal land alpha data sets. 

Data sets the subdirectories of this repository are organised by alpha projects being run the Digital Land organisation.

Prototypes of services using this data are being built by Digital Land.

The intention is for these data sets to evolve here as the alpha projects progress. Evetually, if/when real data sets are published by planning authorities these datasets will no longer be necessary.
